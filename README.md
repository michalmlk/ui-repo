# UI playground

Some place on my GH, when I'm trying to do some unconventional and awesome. 

Testing my skills in styling and building a11y friendly user interfaces.
Mainly using: 
```json
SCSS modules
Storybook
styled-components

..and whatever I want 👀
```
## Stay tuned ⚛️⚡️

## Implemented (but not finally styled yet):
* Several button animation variants
* Accordion component
* Accordion group
* Combobox
* Input
